and DataScience
What if machines could predict your choices, understand and quantify your emotions, and
anticipateyourneedsbeforeyoucanevenarticulatethem? Thisisnottheplotofasciencefictionnovel;
it is the reality as it is being shaped by today’s Artificial Intelligence (AI), a field at the intersection
of computer science, mathematics, and cognitive science, that has revolutionized how we interact with
technology andhowtechnology interacts with theworld.
In the 1950s, pioneers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy, laid the foundation for modern AI
research. Althoughamorerecentterm,datasciencehasrootsinstatisticsanddataanalysisthatdateback

Transforming Paradigms in AI & Related Disciplines: AI is fundamentally about creating
systemsthatcanperformtasksthattypicallyrequirehumanintelligence. Thesetasksrangefromsimple
tasks that can be described through rules to pattern recognition in vast datasets to make autonomous
decisions.
AIinvolves avarietyoftechniquesandapproaches:
• Logical/Symbolic AI: Logical AI – often also referred to as Symbolic AI – utilizes ontologies
andknowledgebasestomakeinferencesakintohumanreasoning. Forinstance,expertsystemsin
medicaldiagnosiscaninferdiseasesbased on symptoms andmedical history using logicalrules.
• Search and Planning: This involves algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search, which is crucial
for applications such as strategic gameplay and logistics planning. An example is the AlphaGo
program, which defeated the world champion in the game of Go by employing advanced search
techniques.
• Agent-based Systems: These systems focus on creating autonomous agents that perceive their
environment, make decisions, and act upon them to achieve specific goals. Examples include18

meetings.
As a subset of AI, Machine Learning (ML) empowers systems to learn from data and improve over
timewithout beingexplicitly programmed. It is divided intoseveralparadigms:
• SupervisedLearning: Insupervisedlearning,algorithmsaretrainedonlabeleddata,learningto
predictoutcomesbasedonpastdata;e.g.,emailfiltering,wherealgorithmslearntoclassifyemails
asspamornon-spam.
• Unsupervised Learning: This approach involves finding hidden patterns in data without prede-
fined labels. Techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction are used in market segmen-
tation andanomalydetection.
• Self-Supervised Learning: This method bridges the gap between supervised and unsupervised
learning by generating labels from the data itself. For example, models can predict the next word
in a sentence,learning language patternsfrom large text corpora.
• Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, agents learn by interacting with their envi-
ronment,receivingrewardsorpenaltiesbasedontheiractions. Thistechniqueiscrucialinrobotics

ods, processes, algorithms, and (data management and other types of information) systems to extract
knowledgeand insights fromstructured andunstructureddata involvingseveralkeyprocesses:
• Data Cleaning: Ensuring the quality and accuracy of data through preprocessing steps like
handlingmissing values, removingduplicates, andcorrecting errors.
• ExploratoryDataAnalysis(EDA):Employingstatisticaltoolsandtechniquestouncoverpatterns,
