# AI-Powered Real-Time Support Tool for Self-Paced Studying

## Overview

This application serves as the user interface for the SelfPacedStudy platform, offering real-time assistance and support
to
learners engaged in self-paced study through pre-recorded online lecture videos and accompanying slides. Our AI-powered
support tool, the Lecture Learning Model (LLM), acts as a chatbot, responding to user queries based on the lecture video
and slides provided. The LLM uses the lecture video and slides transcripts as context to provide more accurate answers
to your questions.
The SelfPacedStudy is designed to be simple and easy to use, so a user would not have any distractions when studying
via. this platform.
Developed for the Project Week at TUM.
